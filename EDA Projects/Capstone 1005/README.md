## 1.1 Company Introduction - Accredian Telecom

Accredian Telecom is a leading player in the telecommunications industry, providing a wide range of services to millions of users. As the industry becomes increasingly competitive, Accredian Telecom recognizes the importance of personalization and customization in order to stay ahead. With this goal in mind, the company aims to leverage the vast amount of behavioral data generated by mobile devices active daily in India. By harnessing this data, Accredian Telecom can help its clients better understand their target audiences and enhance their interactions.

## 1.2 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive dashboard that enables a deep understanding of users' demographic characteristics, mobile usage patterns, geolocation information, and mobile device properties. Through careful analysis of these data points, the dashboard will provide valuable insights to millions of developers and brand advertisers, facilitating data-driven marketing efforts. By understanding user preferences, behavior, and demographics, the dashboard will support the creation of highly relevant marketing strategies, resulting in more effective campaigns and better audience engagement.

## 1.3 Objectives

The key objectives of this project are as follows:

- **Acquiring and preparing the necessary data for analysis:** The project will involve retrieving and processing three primary datasets: demographic information (including user gender and age), mobile device properties (brand and model), and event data (capturing mobile usage, geolocation, and timestamps).

- **Performing demographic analysis based on user gender and age segments:** The project will examine the distribution of Accredian Telecom users by gender and age segments. This analysis will provide insights into the composition of the user base and help identify any demographic trends or patterns.

- **Conducting geographical analysis to understand the distribution of Accredian Telecom users in focus states:** By analyzing the geolocation data of users, the project will explore the distribution of Accredian Telecom users across different states. This analysis will shed light on the concentration of users in specific regions and enable a better understanding of the company's reach.

- **Analyzing phone brand preferences among Accredian Telecom users:** The project will investigate the distribution of phone brands among Accredian Telecom users. This analysis will provide insights into the popularity of different brands within the user base and help identify any brand preferences or correlations with demographic factors.

- **Exploring user activity patterns, including hourly distribution of phone calls and user activity time analysis:** The project will delve into user activity patterns by examining the hourly distribution of phone calls and analyzing user activity over time. This analysis will offer valuable insights into user engagement patterns, peak usage hours, and potential trends in mobile usage behavior.

- **Summarizing the findings, providing actionable insights, and making recommendations for further analysis:** The project will summarize the key findings from the various analyses conducted. It will provide actionable insights for marketers and developers, helping them optimize their strategies and campaigns. Additionally, the project will suggest recommendations for further analysis to explore additional dimensions of the data and extract deeper insights.

By achieving these objectives, the project aims to empower Accredian Telecom and its clients with a powerful data-driven dashboard that facilitates targeted marketing, audience understanding, and enhanced user engagement.

Vintnest, an American Wine Company is pretty famous for it quality of wine. 

They are planning to enter the Indian market to make the most out the this recent growth spurt.

However due to limited availability of their Master Sommelier, they intend to use AI as an Advanced and effective solution to find out the best ingredients that suite the local palate and the weather in the shortest possible time.

# **Data Acquisition & Description**

- For the markets in the U.S Vintest has collected data over the past few years that connects human quality of tasting to laboratory-based physiochemical tests.

- They also intend find a solution for increased control over certification, quality assessment and assurance process though this exercise.

- We are working with a direct source of link to head start our work.

- Features of the data set as per Vintest:

|Id|Feature|Description|
|:--|:--|:--|
|01|Fixed Acidity| Most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily).| 
|02|Volatile Acidity|The amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste.| 
|03|Citric Acid|Found in small quantities, citric acid can add ‘freshness’ and flavor to wines.| 
|04|Residual Sugar | The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it’s rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter |
|||Wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet.|
|05| Chlorides| The amount of salt in the wine.|
|06| Free sulfur dioxide  | Free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion|
|||It prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine.|
|07|  Total sulfur dioxide | Amount of free and bound forms of S02| 
|||In low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine|
|||At free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine|
|08| Density| The density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content|
|09| pH | Describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic);|
||| Most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale.|
|10| Sulphates| A wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant.|
|11| Alcohol| The percent alcohol content of the wine.|
|12| Quality| Score between 0 to 10.|
