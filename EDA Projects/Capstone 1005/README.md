# **Introduction**

## 1.1 Company Introduction - Accredian Telecom

Accredian Telecom is a leading player in the telecommunications industry, providing a wide range of services to millions of users. As the industry becomes increasingly competitive, Accredian Telecom recognizes the importance of personalization and customization in order to stay ahead. With this goal in mind, the company aims to leverage the vast amount of behavioral data generated by mobile devices active daily in India. By harnessing this data, Accredian Telecom can help its clients better understand their target audiences and enhance their interactions.

## 1.2 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive dashboard that enables a deep understanding of users' demographic characteristics, mobile usage patterns, geolocation information, and mobile device properties. Through careful analysis of these data points, the dashboard will provide valuable insights to millions of developers and brand advertisers, facilitating data-driven marketing efforts. By understanding user preferences, behavior, and demographics, the dashboard will support the creation of highly relevant marketing strategies, resulting in more effective campaigns and better audience engagement.

## 1.3 Objectives

The key objectives of this project are as follows:

- **Acquiring and preparing the necessary data for analysis:** The project will involve retrieving and processing three primary datasets: demographic information (including user gender and age), mobile device properties (brand and model), and event data (capturing mobile usage, geolocation, and timestamps).

- **Performing demographic analysis based on user gender and age segments:** The project will examine the distribution of Accredian Telecom users by gender and age segments. This analysis will provide insights into the composition of the user base and help identify any demographic trends or patterns.

- **Conducting geographical analysis to understand the distribution of Accredian Telecom users in focus states:** By analyzing the geolocation data of users, the project will explore the distribution of Accredian Telecom users across different states. This analysis will shed light on the concentration of users in specific regions and enable a better understanding of the company's reach.

- **Analyzing phone brand preferences among Accredian Telecom users:** The project will investigate the distribution of phone brands among Accredian Telecom users. This analysis will provide insights into the popularity of different brands within the user base and help identify any brand preferences or correlations with demographic factors.

- **Exploring user activity patterns, including hourly distribution of phone calls and user activity time analysis:** The project will delve into user activity patterns by examining the hourly distribution of phone calls and analyzing user activity over time. This analysis will offer valuable insights into user engagement patterns, peak usage hours, and potential trends in mobile usage behavior.

- **Summarizing the findings, providing actionable insights, and making recommendations for further analysis:** The project will summarize the key findings from the various analyses conducted. It will provide actionable insights for marketers and developers, helping them optimize their strategies and campaigns. Additionally, the project will suggest recommendations for further analysis to explore additional dimensions of the data and extract deeper insights.

By achieving these objectives, the project aims to empower Accredian Telecom and its clients with a powerful data-driven dashboard that facilitates targeted marketing, audience understanding, and enhanced user engagement.
Company Introduction - AE Corp

Our client for this project is a retail banking institution.

- They are going to float a stock trading facility for their existing customers.
- The idea is to use data to classify whether a customer belongs to a high net worth or low net worth group.
- They will have to incentivize their customers to adopt their offerings.
- One way to incentivize could be to offer discounts on the commission for trading transactions.

Current Scenario

The company rolled out this service to about 10,000+ of its customers and observed their trading behavior for 6 months and after that, they labeled them into two revenue grids 1 and 2.

---

# **Problem Statement**

The current process suffers from the following problems:

- Only about 10% of the customers do enough trades for earnings after discounts to be profitable.
- The company wants to figure out, which are those 10% customers so that it can selectively offer them a discount.

# **Project Details**

- Co-ordinating with - The marketing department to supplement their campaigns with a more proactive approach.
- Our Role - To build a classification model using the datasets.
- Project Deliverables - Predict whether a customer belongs to a high net worth or low net worth group.
- Machine Learning Task: Classification
- Target Variable: Status (high net worth (1) / low net worth (2))
- Win Condition - No machine learning model in the company for this currently, therefore no quantifiable win condition. We just need to build the best possible model.
- Evaluation Metric - The model evaluation will be based on the F1 Score score.

# **Data Acquisition & Description**

We are provided with a dataset containing all the necessary information about the customers like their occupation, family income, gender, region, balance transfer, children, etc.

Also included in the dataset is the column Revenue_Grid which classifies the customers into high net worth customers (1) and low net worth customers (2).

This is the data that we have to predict for future customers.

- Train Set: The train set contains 8124 rows and 32 columns.The last column Revenue_Grid is the target variable.

- Test Set: The test set contains 2031 rows and 31 columns.The test set doesn’t contain the Revenue_Grid column which need to be predicted

# **Introduction**

Drinking wine in moderation will give you tons of health benefits.
 
- Polyphenols  - to fight against free radicals which are harmful to your body. 
- Flavonoids  - to improve your cardiovascular health. 
- Resveratrol content  - to enhance your memory. 

Aside from the health benefits of drinking wine, it also provides you with various social benefits. 

- Interacting with your colleagues at work. 
- Dealing with your neighbours. 
- Hanging out with your circle of friends
- Meeting new people. 

Probably that is why the Wine industry shows a recent growth spurt & social drinking is on the rise.

# **Problem Statement**

**The price of wine depends on a rather abstract concept of wine appreciation by wine tasters.**

A Master Sommelier Diploma Exam is considered as the toughest and hardest exam in the world . This exam is a wine-tasting test for expert winemakers. 

There are roughly 269 Master Sommeliers in the world today.

The median sommelier salary in the U.S across 4 levels of certification is $62,000. 

- A beginner sommelier makes roughly U.S $ 40,000 - 50,000. 
- At level 2 this number goes to U.S $ 60,000 - 70,000.

Vintnest, an American Wine Company is pretty famous for it quality of wine. 

They are planning to enter the Indian market to make the most out the this recent growth spurt.

However due to limited availability of their Master Sommelier, they intend to use AI as an Advanced and effective solution to find out the best ingredients that suite the local palate and the weather in the shortest possible time.

# **Data Acquisition & Description**

- For the markets in the U.S Vintest has collected data over the past few years that connects human quality of tasting to laboratory-based physiochemical tests.

- They also intend find a solution for increased control over certification, quality assessment and assurance process though this exercise.

- We are working with a direct source of link to head start our work.

- Features of the data set as per Vintest:

|Id|Feature|Description|
|:--|:--|:--|
|01|Fixed Acidity| Most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily).| 
|02|Volatile Acidity|The amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste.| 
|03|Citric Acid|Found in small quantities, citric acid can add ‘freshness’ and flavor to wines.|
