# **Introduction**

Drinking wine in moderation will give you tons of health benefits.
 
- Polyphenols  - to fight against free radicals which are harmful to your body. 
- Flavonoids  - to improve your cardiovascular health. 
- Resveratrol content  - to enhance your memory. 

Aside from the health benefits of drinking wine, it also provides you with various social benefits. 

- Interacting with your colleagues at work. 
- Dealing with your neighbours. 
- Hanging out with your circle of friends
- Meeting new people. 

Probably that is why the Wine industry shows a recent growth spurt & social drinking is on the rise.

# **Problem Statement**

**The price of wine depends on a rather abstract concept of wine appreciation by wine tasters.**

A Master Sommelier Diploma Exam is considered as the toughest and hardest exam in the world . This exam is a wine-tasting test for expert winemakers. 

There are roughly 269 Master Sommeliers in the world today.

The median sommelier salary in the U.S across 4 levels of certification is $62,000. 

- A beginner sommelier makes roughly 40- 50 Thousand dollars. 
- At level 2 this number goes to 60-70 Thousnad dollars.

Vintnest, an American Wine Company is pretty famous for it quality of wine. 

They are planning to enter the Indian market to make the most out the this recent growth spurt.

However due to limited availability of their Master Sommelier, they intend to use AI as an Advanced and effective solution to find out the best ingredients that suite the local palate and the weather in the shortest possible time.

# **Data Acquisition & Description**

- For the markets in the U.S Vintest has collected data over the past few years that connects human quality of tasting to laboratory-based physiochemical tests.

- They also intend find a solution for increased control over certification, quality assessment and assurance process though this exercise.

- We are working with a direct source of link to head start our work.

- Features of the data set as per Vintest:

|Id|Feature|Description|
|:--|:--|:--|
|01|Fixed Acidity| Most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily).| 
|02|Volatile Acidity|The amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste.| 
|03|Citric Acid|Found in small quantities, citric acid can add ‘freshness’ and flavor to wines.| 
|04|Residual Sugar | The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it’s rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter |
|||Wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet.|
|05| Chlorides| The amount of salt in the wine.|
|06| Free sulfur dioxide  | Free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion|
|||It prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine.|
|07|  Total sulfur dioxide | Amount of free and bound forms of S02| 
|||In low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine|
|||At free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine|
|08| Density| The density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content|
|09| pH | Describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic);|
||| Most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale.|
|10| Sulphates| A wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant.|
|11| Alcohol| The percent alcohol content of the wine.|
|12| Quality| Score between 0 to 10.|
