## 1.1 Company Introduction - Workboat News

Workboat News is a prominent player in the media industry, delivering timely and accurate news to a diverse audience. As the media landscape evolves, the News Agency recognizes the need to adapt to modern consumption habits. In an era where digital platforms dominate, the agency aims to provide a personalized and seamless news-reading experience. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, the News Agency seeks to enhance user engagement and ensure that readers receive news content tailored to their interests.

## 1.2 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated news classification model that can categorize news articles into predefined categories. This model will serve as the backbone of a mobile app designed to deliver personalized news content to users. By analyzing headlines and short descriptions, the model will predict the category of each news article, enabling the app to curate news feeds based on user preferences. This project will not only streamline news delivery but also improve user satisfaction by reducing information overload and presenting relevant content.

## 1.3 Objectives

The key objectives of this project are as follows:

- **Acquiring and preparing the necessary data for analysis:** The project involves retrieving and processing a comprehensive dataset containing news categories, headlines, descriptions, dates, and links. This dataset is crucial for training and validating the news classification model.

- **Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data:** The project will conduct an in-depth analysis of the dataset to uncover patterns and trends. This analysis will provide insights into the distribution of news categories, the frequency of different keywords in headlines, and the overall structure of the data.

- **Implementing text preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare the text data:** The project will involve cleaning the text data by removing unnecessary characters, punctuation, and stop words. It will also include tokenization, stemming, and vectorization to convert the text into a suitable format for model training.

- **Building and evaluating a text classification model to categorize news articles:** The project will explore various machine learning and deep learning models, such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, LSTM, GRU, and BERT-based models. The models will be trained and validated using the prepared dataset, and their performance will be evaluated using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.

- **Optimizing the model for better performance:** The project will include hyperparameter tuning and regularization techniques to enhance the model's accuracy and prevent overfitting. This step is critical to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

- **Integrating the final model into a news recommender system:** The trained model will be used to classify incoming news articles in real-time. The classified articles will then be passed to a news recommender system, which will fetch and display top news articles based on user preferences.

- **Summarizing the findings, providing actionable insights, and making recommendations for future improvements:** The project will conclude with a summary of key findings from the analyses and model evaluations. It will offer actionable insights to the News Agency for enhancing their news delivery platform and suggest areas for future research and model improvements.

By achieving these objectives, the project aims to empower the News Agency with a robust and scalable solution for personalized news delivery, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.
