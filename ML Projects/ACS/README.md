# **Project Overview**

Our client, the Human Resources (HR) Department of a prominent software company, has embarked on a mission to enhance employee retention through data-driven strategies. The core objective of this initiative is to employ predictive analytics to identify employees who are at risk of leaving the company. By proactively identifying and addressing potential attrition, HR aims to foster a more engaged and satisfied workforce.

# **Current Practices and Challenges**

The current practice employed by the HR Department involves conducting exit interviews with departing employees to gather insights into their reasons for leaving. However, this approach presents several challenges:

1. **Haphazard Insights:** The quality and depth of insights obtained through exit interviews vary greatly depending on the skills of the interviewer. This inconsistency hinders the HR Department's ability to gain meaningful and actionable insights.

2. **Lack of Aggregated Data:** Insights collected through exit interviews are typically isolated and cannot be effectively aggregated or cross-referenced across multiple employees who have left. This limits the ability to identify overarching patterns or trends.

3. **Timing:** By the time policy changes are implemented based on exit interview findings, it may be too late to prevent attrition, resulting in valuable talent loss.

# **Our Role and Objectives**

In response to these challenges, the HR Department has enlisted us as data science consultants to implement a proactive approach to employee retention. Our primary task is to develop a robust classification model that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company. By harnessing historical employee data, we aim to provide HR with a tool that can identify at-risk employees well in advance, allowing for timely intervention.

# **Problem Specifics**

- Deliverable: Our goal is to predict whether an employee will stay with the company or leave.

- Machine Learning Task: This project falls under the classification domain.

- Target Variable: The target variable is 'Status,' indicating whether an employee is currently employed or has left the company.

- Win Condition: Given that this is a unique problem for the company, there is no predefined quantifiable win condition. Our objective is to build the most effective predictive model possible.

# **Data Sources**

To accomplish this task, we have been provided with three critical datasets:

- 1. Department Data
   - This dataset offers insights into various departments within the organization, providing details such as department codes, names, and department heads.

- 2. Employee Details Data
   - This dataset encompasses employee-specific information, including unique employee IDs, age, gender, and marital status.

- 3. Employee Data
   - This comprehensive dataset encompasses administrative, workload, mutual evaluation data, and employment status.
   
- Target Variable:
   - 'Status' represents the current employment status, classified as 'Employed' or 'Left.'

Within these datasets, we will explore various factors such as departmental affiliations, salary levels, tenure, recent promotions, workload metrics, and mutual evaluation scores, among others.

Our mission is to leverage these datasets to create a powerful predictive model that enables HR to take proactive measures in retaining valuable talent within the organization.
