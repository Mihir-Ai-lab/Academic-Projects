# **1. Introduction**
---

We learnt about a few different kinds of Machine Learning Algorithms. :-

- Linear/Logistic Regression
- Decession Trees
- Random forest Classifier
- Naive Bayes

Under this we mainly understood :- 

- Thier pros & cons
- Evaluation Metrics (Precession, Recall, F1 score)
- Hyper Parameter Tuning (Solving for Bias/Variance & Over/Under-fitting)
- Data preparation for the models (SMOTE)
- Feature Scaling & Feature engineering techniques (PCA)
- Drawbacks of the models

Based on which we intend to make a summary notebook of what all we learnt.
