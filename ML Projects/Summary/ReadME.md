# **Introduction**
---

We learnt about a few different kinds of Machine Learning Algorithms. :-

- Linear/Logistic Regression
- Decession Trees
- Random forest Classifier
- Naive Bayes

Under this we mainly understood :- 

- Thier pros & cons
- Evaluation Metrics (Precession, Recall, F1 score)
- Hyper Parameter Tuning (Solving for Bias/Variance & Over/Under-fitting)
- Data preparation for the models (SMOTE)
- Feature Scaling & Feature engineering techniques (PCA)
- Drawbacks of the models

Based on which we intend to make a summary notebook of what all we learnt.

# **Objective**
---

The main objective of this project is to explore and understand different machine learning algorithms and their applications in solving classification problems. Specifically, we aim to:

- Gain a comprehensive understanding of the pros and cons of each machine learning algorithm, including Linear/Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest Classifier, and Naive Bayes.
- Learn how to evaluate the performance of each model using various evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Explore techniques for hyperparameter tuning to prevent over/under-fitting and solve for bias/variance.
- Understand the importance of data preparation techniques such as SMOTE and feature scaling/engineering techniques such as PCA.
- Build and evaluate models using a loan dataset to predict whether a loan applicant will default or not, and compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms.
- Summarize what we have learned about each machine learning algorithm and its potential applications in solving real-world problems.
