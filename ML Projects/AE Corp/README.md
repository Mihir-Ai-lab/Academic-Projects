# **Introduction**

Company Introduction - AE Corp

Our client for this project is a retail banking institution.

- They are going to float a stock trading facility for their existing customers.
- The idea is to use data to classify whether a customer belongs to a high net worth or low net worth group.
- They will have to incentivize their customers to adopt their offerings.
- One way to incentivize could be to offer discounts on the commission for trading transactions.

Current Scenario

The company rolled out this service to about 10,000+ of its customers and observed their trading behavior for 6 months and after that, they labeled them into two revenue grids 1 and 2.

# **Problem Statement**

The current process suffers from the following problems:

- Only about 10% of the customers do enough trades for earnings after discounts to be profitable.
- The company wants to figure out, which are those 10% customers so that it can selectively offer them a discount.

# **Project Details**

- Co-ordinating with - The marketing department to supplement their campaigns with a more proactive approach.
- Our Role - To build a classification model using the datasets.
- Project Deliverables - Predict whether a customer belongs to a high net worth or low net worth group.
- Machine Learning Task: Classification
- Target Variable: Status (high net worth (1) / low net worth (2))
- Win Condition - No machine learning model in the company for this currently, therefore no quantifiable win condition. We just need to build the best possible model.
- Evaluation Metric - The model evaluation will be based on the F1 Score score.

# **Data Acquisition & Description**

We are provided with a dataset containing all the necessary information about the customers like their occupation, family income, gender, region, balance transfer, children, etc.

Also included in the dataset is the column Revenue_Grid which classifies the customers into high net worth customers (1) and low net worth customers (2).

This is the data that we have to predict for future customers.

- Train Set: The train set contains 8124 rows and 32 columns.The last column Revenue_Grid is the target variable.

- Test Set: The test set contains 2031 rows and 31 columns.The test set doesnâ€™t contain the Revenue_Grid column which need to be predicted
